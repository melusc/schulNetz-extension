# schulNetz marks summariser

This is a simple extension that summarises your marks and lets you know if you're passing or not.

<br>

You're passing if

- you have an average higher than equal to `4.0`
- you can compensate every mark below `4.0` twice (`3.0` needs `5.0` twice)
- You have no more than three marks below `4.0`

Only if all the above apply are you good.
